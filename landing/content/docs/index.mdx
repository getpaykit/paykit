PayKit is a TypeScript-first payments orchestration framework for modern SaaS.
It sits between your app and payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, regional PSPs),
providing a unified API without vendor lock-in.

PayKit does **not** process payments. It orchestrates them.

<Callout type="warn">
  PayKit is in early development. APIs are subject to change. See the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) for the current status.

## Who is PayKit for?

PayKit is designed for SaaS companies that:

- Operate in **multiple regions** with different payment preferences
- Use **multiple payment providers** and need a unified interface
- Need **subscriptions**, usage billing, or hybrid models
- Want **full control** over their payments data
- Want to **avoid vendor lock-in** with any single provider

## How it works

```
Your App → PayKit Core → Provider Adapter → Stripe / PayPal / ...
```

PayKit acts as a coordination layer. Your application talks to PayKit through a single, typed API. PayKit routes operations to the correct provider adapter, normalizes webhooks, and keeps your database as the single source of truth.

**PayKit is a payments layer, not a product catalog.** Subscriptions, invoices, and usage records live in your database. Your app owns its own products and prices — PayKit receives amounts and descriptions inline. Provider adapters are pure payment rails.

This means:

- Subscriptions are managed by PayKit's own billing engine with cron-based charging, state machine transitions, and retry logic
- Switching a subscription's payment provider is trivial — just change which payment method is charged
- Usage-based billing is first-class, not bolted onto a provider's metered billing API
- Provider adapters are tiny (~5 methods), making new integrations easy

## Core Principles

- **Orchestration, not processing** — PayKit coordinates providers, it does not move money
- **Database is source of truth** — external providers are execution engines, internal state lives in your DB
- **Provider-agnostic** — no provider-specific types leak into the core API
- **Explicit state transitions** — subscription lifecycle is state-machine driven, no implicit side effects
- **No magic** — everything is explicit, typed, and inspectable
- **Minimal API surface** — no speculative options, start with the minimum that works

## What is PayKit?

PayKit is a TypeScript-first payments orchestration framework for modern SaaS.
It sits between your app and payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, regional PSPs),
providing a unified API without vendor lock-in.

PayKit does **not** process payments. It orchestrates them.

## Key Principles

- **Orchestration, not processing** — PayKit coordinates providers, it does not move money
- **Database is source of truth** — external providers are execution engines, internal state lives in your DB
- **Provider-agnostic** — no provider-specific types leak into the core API
- **Explicit state transitions** — subscription lifecycle is state-machine driven
- **No magic** — everything is explicit, typed, and inspectable
